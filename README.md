# hotbit
ASE density-functional tight-binding calculator

## Philosophy behind Hotbit 

Hotbit aims to provide
* an open-source DFTB code
* a companion for DFT,
  - for easy & fast electronic structure analysis
  - to access to dynamical properties
  - to investigate systems of same size
  - for testing, playing around 
* a compact and accessible code for everyone to inspect and modify
  - trying to avoid parallelization, which implies that the code is less suitable for large systems
* an intuitive user interface
  - ideal for learning and teaching realistic electronic structure simulations
